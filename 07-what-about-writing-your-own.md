# Why You should build your own components

## What does this have to do with writing your own components?

I would say, _everything_. When you pull out Material UI to use for your form elements and then Formik for your form validation, and Redux for your state, you aren't making decisions about your own software any more. Those decsions have been pushed off onto people you have never met, and people who have no stake in the quality of your software.

How do you know the code they wrote will do what you want it to do, before implementing it all over your application? How do you know that code will be maintained over time? How many times have you used a library that seemed popular, only to collapse under it's own technical debt and become abandonned? I personally have seen this time and time again.

I would also submit that the biggest downsides of constantly installing someone else's code to do your job for you, is that it does not help you grow your own skills and learn your own craft. You are paid for your knowledge as a programmer. You are paid for your problem solving skills. When you consistently offload anything that you perceive to be difficult, you are stunting your own growth, and making yourslef less valuable and more mediocre.
