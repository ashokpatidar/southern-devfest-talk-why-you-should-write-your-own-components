# Why You should build your own components

## Agility vs Speed

In his talk Agility != Speed, Kevlin Henney explains how business has _duped itself_ into thinking agility is the same as speed, but we know this is not true. _Agility is the ability to change direction quickly_, and a measure of how easy it is to modify what you have previously built.

It's _easy to build monolithic software_. It doesn't take a lot of thought to just continue adding lines to a class, component, or function until it eventually becomes a _ball of mud_ that resists every effort you make to modify it.

Files get longer and longer, and more and _more complex_ and as a result, the code gets sloppier and messier, until not even the original devloper can explain to you how it actuall works.

The velocity of such projects, continues on a downward trend until everytime a project manager asks the development team, "how much more is there left to do before we can launch", the answer becomes, "we are somewhere between 80 and 90% done". Which is where the project will linger for months or longer.
