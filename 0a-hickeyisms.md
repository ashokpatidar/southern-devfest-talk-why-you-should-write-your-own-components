# Shit Rick Hickey (almost) Said

## Why do we just want it to be easy?

Imagine if a band wanted to make the process of making music easier on themselves. Playing guitar and drums and bass is hard. Singing is hard. Writing Melodic, deep lyrics is hard.

That is how you end up with The Kazoo Fighters instead of the Foo Fighters. That is how you end up with the Easy Bake Oven. No one wants to eat a cake baked in the Easy Bake Oven, and no one wants to listen to the Kazoo Fighters.

Who wants to be on the team or part of the company who consistently chooses the easiest possible thing? Rich Hickey doesn't, and neither should you.

## Simplicity is not about you

And it is actually hard work. But, there is a huge payoff. The person who has a simpler system, made out of genuinely simple parts, is going to be able to effect the greatest amount of change in a short period of time. They are going to kick your ass in the long run.
