# Why You should build your own components

## Speed vs Velocity

In software development we frequently hear the work velocity being used, and mostly it is used as a synonym for speed. But I would argue that these two words are not the same. Speed is the distance traveled in an amount of time, while velocity is the same plus a directional component.

In many greenfield projects I have watched everyone enamored by the relative speed of supposed progress being made daily (at least in the first few weeks) and then things start to go downhill and before you know it, everything is a slog, and reason for this is, no one was thinking about direction.

Are we taking care of technical debt? Are we refactoring our code? Are we challenging and mentoring our Jr developers? Are we reviewing code and do we have specific standards that go beyond some lofty vague principles or arguments over spaces vs tabs and function line length?

These are all questions that concern direction, and if addressed, they will slow down a project in the beginning. But what is better? Driving at 200 kph in the wrong direction, or walking briskly in the generally correct direction?

There is never time to refactor later. There is never time to rewrite it later. There is never time to do tomorrow what you can do today. Tomorrow always has new requirements and deadlines, and they will prevent you from doing the things that you needed to do yesterday, if you let them.
